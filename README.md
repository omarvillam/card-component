# Whiteboard Excercise: Card Component

This is a quick exercise where you will build out a small component and wire up data to it. There is no single correct way to do this, we are interested in observing your thought process. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the contents of this repository. Feel free to ask as 
many questions as you'd like.

**Time Limit:** 30 mins
